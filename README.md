<h1> The BasketBall Store </h1>
<b> MY FIRST JAVA PROJECT AT University of Salerno. <br> (late 2014)</b>

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> I have developed an environment that facilitates the user in purchasing sports equipment other than e-commerce. All the user has to do is register and start browsing the product catalog, so as to choose what they are most interested in </p>

<h2> E-commerce features </h2>
<p> The customer can choose the product from a constantly updated catalog. Each product has:
<br>• Detailed description
<br>• Front and back image
<br>•	Cut it
<br>• Price
<br>• Availability
<br>
To make the purchase, the customer must be registered on our portal, must have a Credit Card / Prepaid Card / Debit Card (the following services will be added soon: Paypal, Neteller, Skrill), and enter their personal data for the order shipping and billing. </p>
